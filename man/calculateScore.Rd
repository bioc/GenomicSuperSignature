\title{Calculate the validation score for a new dataset}
\usage{
calculateScore(dataset, RAVmodel, rescale.after = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A gene expression matrix, where genes are in rows and rownames
are in 'symbol' format. It can be SummarizedExperiment, ExpressionSet, or matrix objects.}

\item{RAVmodel}{PCAGenomicSignatures object. Output from \code{buildAvgLoading}
function, a matrix of average loadings, can be directly provided.}

\item{rescale.after}{If it is \code{TRUE}, the continuous scores are rescaled
post assignment, so average loadings have the same standard deviation in different
studies. If it is \code{FALSE}, the rescaling of column (= dividing by \code{sqrt(sum(x^2})
is done before score assignment. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the score matrices for input datasets. Scores are
assigned to each sample (row) for each cluster (column).
