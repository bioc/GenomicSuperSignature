\usage{
validate(
  dataset,
  PCAmodel,
  method = "pearson",
  maxFrom = "PC",
  level = "max",
  scale = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Single or a list of SummarizedExperiment (RangedSummarizedExperiment,
ExpressionSet or matrix) object(s). Gene names should be in 'symbol' format.}

\item{PCAmodel}{PCAGenomicSignature object. You can also provide signature model matrix directly.}

\item{method}{A character string indicating which correlation coefficient is
to be computed. One of "pearson" (default), "kendall", or "spearman": can be abbreviated.}

\item{maxFrom}{Select whether to display the maximum value from dataset's PCs or avgLoadings.
Under the default (\code{maxFrom="PC"}), the maximum correlation coefficient from
top 8 PCs for each avgLoading will be selected as an output.If you choose (\code{maxFrom="avgLoading"}),
the avgLoading with the maximum correlation coefficient with each PC will be in the output.}

\item{level}{Defibe how to ouput validation in two different forms, \code{c("max", "all")}.
Default is "max", which outputs the matrix containing only the maximum coefficient.
To get the coefficient of all 8 PCs, set this argument as "all".}

\item{scale}{Default is \code{FALSE}. If it is set to \code{TRUE}, dataset will
be row normalized by \link{rowNorm} function.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the maximum pearson correlation coefficient between
the top 8 PCs of the dataset and pre-calculated average loadings (in row) of training
datasets (\code{score} column). It also contains other metadata associated with
each PCcluster: \code{PC} for one of the top 8 PCs of the dataset that results
in the given \code{score}, \code{sw} for the average silhouette width of the PCcluster,
\code{cl_size} for the size of each PCcluster.
If the input for \code{dataset} argument is a list of different datasets, each row
of the output represents a new dataset for test, and each column represents
clusters from training datasets. If \code{level = "all"}, a list containing the matrices
of the pearson correlation coefficient between all top 8 PCs of the datasets and
avgLoading.
